# Chapter 2 - Program Structure
## Expressions and Statements
- A fragment of code that produces a value is called an *expression*. Every value that is written literally is an expression.
- "Expressions can contain other expressions in a way similar to how subsentences in human language are nested -- a substence can contain its own subsentences, and so on."
- If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, a JavaScript *statement* corresponds to a full sentence. A program is a list of statements.
- Statements are encapsulated by semicolons (;).
