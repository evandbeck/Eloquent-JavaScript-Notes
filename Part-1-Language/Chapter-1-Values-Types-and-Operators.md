# Chapter 1 - Values, Types, and Operators
- "Inside the computer's world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new data -- but that which isn't data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamnetally alike."
- *Bits* are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones.
## Values
- A typical modern computer has more than 30 billion bits in its volatile data storage (working memory); non-volatile storage (the hard disk or equivalent) tends to have yet a few orders of magnitude more.
- Separate these bits of memory into chunks, in a JavaScript environment these chunks are called *Values*.
- Every value has a type that determines its role, such as numbers, text, functions, etc.
- Every value has to be stored somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic amount of them at the same time, you might run out of memory.
