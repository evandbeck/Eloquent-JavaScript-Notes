# My Notes

- These are my notes on the book Eloquent JavaScript, by Marijn Haverbeke.
- My goal is to continue to learn and sharpen my fundamental JS skills, practice my understanding of MD, further utilize git/GitHub in my daily routine, and improve my typing.
- These notes won't be exhaustive, they'll be a bit more high-level and provide me opportunities to take them where I see fit.
- I'll add more general thoughts here as I have them.
