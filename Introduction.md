# Introduction
- *Programming* is the act of constructing a *program* -- a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.
- A *programming language* is an artifically constructed language used to instruct computers.
- "It is interesting that the most effective way we've found to communicate with a computer borrows from the way we communicate with each other."
##  On Programming
- "The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but programs built on top of these tools tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and complexity."
- "When action is unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unproftiable, sleep." - Ursula K. Guin, *The Left Hand of Darkness*
- "A program is a building of thought."
- "A sense of what a good program looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a list of rules."
## Why Language Matters
- "...The same program can be expressed in both long and short, unreadable and readable ways."
- "A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk about the actions tthat the computer has to perform on a higher level."
## What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser.
- Also known as ECMAScript standard, after the Ecma International organization that did the standardization.
- Web platforms are not the only platforms JavaScript can be used, also databases such as MongoDB or server programming, Node.js.
## Code, and What to Do with It
- *Code* is the text that makes up programs.
- "...Reading and writing code are indespensible parts of learning to program."
